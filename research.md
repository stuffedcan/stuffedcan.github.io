As a child, I believe that besides wanting to be an astronaut, ballerina, doctor and magician, I’ve always wanted to be a scientist. I think I’ve just spent too many hours playing with my optical microscope analysing the epidermis of onion bulbs and everything I would put my hands on!

Anyways, my first real endeavour in science occurred in the last year of my Bachelor when we had to present a thesis and defend it. Two options were given: <i>i)</i> a review-style manuscript or <i>ii)</i> an laboratory internship from where a thesis should derive. Off course, the excitement was in the latter option, and so I followed! There were many respectable laboratories in the [Faculty of Sciences and Technology](http://www.fct.unl.pt/en/), but none that sparked my interest as in the [Institute of Hygiene and Tropical Medicine](http://www.ihmt.unl.pt/). I managed to get an interview for an internship as a Research Fellow in the Centre of Malaria and other Tropical Diseases, I it is in all honesty that I believe that I got the position because of how passionately described my desire to work in neglected tropical diseases such as malaria and help those affected by them.

It was only during my Master that I found Virology as a field with so many possibilities and interesting parasites that assumed so many shapes, pathologies and evolutionary dynamics. Meanwhile during my ERASMUS mobility programme I was introduced to a new way to study viruses through Computational Biology. I was drawn by it immediately despite my background in Biology. 

Finally, in my PhD project I was able to further apply phylogenetic and coalescent methods, as well as extend phylogeographic approaches methods under Bayesian inference, to assess the public health threats of viral epidemics and gain insight into the emergence and early transmission dynamics, even before systematic epidemiological surveillance has been initiated. 

My current research goals are directed towards using the historical information contained in viral gene sequences to understand patterns in disease transmission, with a particular focus on connecting the evolutionary process with geography and ecological patterns of host/vector species, which may prove valuable to investigate the dynamics of many pathogens. 

In particular, I aim to advance phylogeographic inference from a traditionally descriptive approach to a hypothesis testing framework. My specific applications are motivated to gain insight into plant, avian and human influenza viruses spatio-temporal dynamics.
Additionally, I am also integrated in several projects regarding the phylodynamic reconstruction of HBV in several Middle East countries.
