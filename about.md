I created this website to host my work thoughts, endeavours and related analyses of what is going on in the world.

Right now, I am a PhD student in the field of Evolutionary Virology in the [laboratory of Professor Philippe Lemey](http://rega.kuleuven.be/cev/ecv) at the [KULeuven](http://www.kuleuven.be/english), Belgium. In my project I integrate the concepts of molecular epidemiology and evolutionary biology to study viral phylodynamic processes at different biological scales, which will culminate in a doctoral thesis entitled "The genetic traceability of viral pathogens: from isolation by distance to proximity by mobility".

Before working on Phylodynamics, I earned my Master's degree in Biomedical Sciences from the [Institute of Hygiene and Tropical Medicine](http://www.ihmt.unl.pt/) in Portugal, where I did the academic program, and the KULeuven where I developed my thesis integrated in a project involving the development of a HIV-1 group M near full genome next-generation sequencing protocol, under the supervision of [Eng. Bram Vrancken](https://rega.kuleuven.be/cev/ecv/lab-members/BramVrancken.html) and [Professor Philippe Lemey](https://rega.kuleuven.be/cev/ecv/lab-members/PhilippeLemey.html).

During my Bachelor degree in Molecular and Cellular Biology at the [Universidade Nova de Lisboa](http://www.unl.pt/en/), Portugal, I was a Research fellow in the Centre of Malaria and other Tropical Diseases, in [IHTM](http://www.ihmt.unl.pt/) where under the acquisition of resistance to multiple drugs (ARMD) project I successfully defended my thesis on "Phenotyping and genotyping of <i>Plasmodium chabaudi</i> clones resistant to artemisinin and artesunate”, under the supervision of Dr. Ana Afonso and Professor Virgílio do Rosário.
